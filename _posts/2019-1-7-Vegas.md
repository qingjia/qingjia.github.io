Dec, 24 : Flight  to Las Vegas, Stay in Planet Holly Wood.

​        Planet Hollywood located in the middle of strip street, it's close to Liberty Statute and Effie Tower. The Hotel is very cheap in Vegas, but there is resort fee, it normally charge you 30  to 50 bucks per night. At first I plan to stay in Circus, but I change my mind after I saw a comments about it. <!--"it's only one step above the homeless shelter".--> Venetian and Bally's is also good choice to stay.

Dec,26: Drive to San Diego

​        From Vegas to San Diego is a boring drive ..., plan 6 hours, but it take me 8 hours due to traffic, the California traffic

​        Lobster, I must say don't miss the lobster when you in California, I order a bucket, it's good for me, my wife and my boy. 
when drive to Yuma, there is  border security check because it's close to Mexico. 
Visit the Dessert Botanical Gardern, it's not in my plan.

Dec,29: Drive to Sedona

​        The Hotel is expensive in Sedona, so I stay in Cottonwood.

​        The Holly Cross Chapel is the most beautiful chapel in the world!

Dec,30: Grand Canyon,

​        Because the government is closed, Grand Canyon is free. At the entrance, I was curious why there is no place to pay, the guy in another lane ask me "did you pay", then I'm know I'm not the only one confused at the situation.Most bathroom is also closed due to government shutdown. it's the biggest negative consequences to the tourist.
I must say Down Jacket is needed when you visit Grand Canyon in winter. Even it's sunny, but it's so cold becasue of the wind.
